# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```sh
# create a new project
npx sv create my-app
```

To recreate this project with the same configuration:

```sh
# recreate this project
npx sv create --template minimal --types ts --no-install .
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## RPC configuration
The launcher UI expects a JSON-RPC endpoint for `launcher-core`.

- `VITE_GENTRO_RPC_URL` (HTTP JSON-RPC URL, recommended for macOS dev)
- `VITE_GENTRO_RPC_SOCKET` (reserved for future Unix socket support)

Example:
```sh
VITE_GENTRO_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8123/rpc npm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
